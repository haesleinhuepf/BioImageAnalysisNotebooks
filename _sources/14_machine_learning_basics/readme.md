# Machine learning basics

In this chapter we will introduce the basics of classical machine learning. We will introduce supervised and unsupervised machine learning and process a simple data set. As the number of algorithms used in this field is overwhelming, we just introduce two classical methods: The Random Forest Classifier (supervised) and k-means clustering (unsupervised). With the knowledge acquired while using these two, one can also use other implementations as these algorithms all work similarly, at least from user's perspective.

To get a wider perspective on available algorithms and methods, the reader is referred to the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning) and [Digital Sreeni's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DigitalSreeni).

## Python libraries used in this chapter
We will use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) which can be installed like this:
```
mamba install scikit-learn
```
