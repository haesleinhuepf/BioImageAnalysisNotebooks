# Plotting

To gain insights, e.g. in biological and biophysical processes, it is unavoidable to plot data. In this chapter, we will learn how to plot scientific data.

## Installing dependencies

In this chapter, we will work with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and those can be installed using conda:

```
conda install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
