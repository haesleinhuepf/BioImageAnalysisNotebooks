# Cell classification

For classifying objects such as cells and nuclei, a common procedure is to use feature extraction and afterwards machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifiers for differentiating objects.

## Installation of required libraries

In this section we will work with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) and [aopc](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc). These two can be installed like this:

```
pip install scikit-learn
```

```
conda install -c conda-forge pyopencl
pip install apoc
```
