# Graphical user interfaces
Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are important when delivering image analysis scripts and tools to colleagues who just want to use the tools and don't care so much about the underlying code. In this section we will demonstrate how one can build custom user interfaces, e.g. using [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari)

## 
In this chapter we will use napari and a napari-plugin called napari crop. Both can be installed by using these commands:

```
conda install napari
pip install napari-crop
```
