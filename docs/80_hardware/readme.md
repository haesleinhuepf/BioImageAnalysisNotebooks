# Choosing the Optimal Computer

Though Python is runnable on most of modern operating systems (OS) including Windows, MacOS and Linux, it is beneficial to keep scripting under *nix environment. To understand difference of OS shell environment check the [page](../03_advanced_python/shell_scripting.md). Here we provide a guide for beginners to choose your computing hardwares.

This guide is intentionally written for programming beginners to code locally.

## General Guide 

When choosing a computer for bioimage analysis, it's essential to consider hardware performance, memory size, OS, portability, and application scenarios. Hereâ€™s a summary comparing different computing modalities:

| **Memory Size**           | Up to 64GB (most have 16GB-32GB)         | Up to 128GB or more                      | 128GB to 512GB or more                   | Terabytes of RAM                         |
| **GPU**                   | Integrated or dedicated GPUs | High-end dedicated GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX) | Professional GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA Quadro/RTX A-series) | Multiple professional GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA Tesla/Quadro) |
| **NPU**                   | SoC Dependent                | Limited NPU support                      | Available in some high-end models        | Available, especially in AI-optimized servers |
| **OS**                    | Windows, macOS, Linux                    | Windows, macOS, Linux                    | Windows, macOS, Linux                           | Linux, Windows Server                    |
| **Portability**           | Highly portable                          | Not portable                             | Not portable                             | Not portable                             |
| **Application Scenarios** | Mobile work, basic to moderate tasks     | Stationary use, moderate to intensive tasks | Intensive tasks, advanced analysis       | Large-scale projects, remote access, collaborative research |
| **ARM vs x86**            | Mostly x86 (some ARM options like Apple Silicon and Snapdragon XLite) | Mostly x86 except for Apple                               | Mostly x86 except for Apple                               | Mostly x86 (ARM servers available, e.g., AWS Graviton) |
| **ARM Performance**       | Energy-efficient, good for battery life  | Limited use, lower performance than x86, suitable for task specific AI like smart microscopy  | Rare, used in specific scenarios         | High efficiency, used in cloud services  |
| **x86 Performance**       | High performance, widely supported. Deprecating in MacOS support.       | Higher performance, widely supported     | Highest performance, widely supported    | Highest performance, widely supported    |


## Key Considerations
- **OS**: Choose the OS based on software compatibility and personal preference. Windows and Linux are common across all device types, with macOS being exclusive to laptops and desktops. More concern is about OS terminal and [shell scripting](../03_advanced_python/shell_scripting.md)
- **Processor Architecture**: ARM processors are known for energy efficiency and are increasingly used in laptops (e.g., Apple M1/M2) and servers (e.g., AWS Graviton). x86 processors dominate in performance and are widely supported across all device types, making them the standard choice for high-performance bioimage analysis tasks. For details check [here](./arch.md).
- **GPU**: Essential for handling complex image processing and analysis. Laptops typically have consumer-grade GPUs, while desktops and workstations offer higher-end consumer or professional-grade GPUs. For independent GPU on laptop the power consumption is very high and limited the portability and sustainable coding environment.  Servers can have multiple high-end GPUs optimized for parallel processing and large-scale computations. Considering the domination of CUDA in AI domain, Nvidia is the only recommended vendor. For details of GPU applications check [here](./gpu.md).
- **NPU**: Neural Processing Units are becoming more relevant for AI and machine learning tasks. The performance across vendors are yet to be benchmarked. To understand more about NPUs read the section [here](./npu.md).

## Should I take ARM chipset for Bioimage Analysis?
- **MacOS**: Yes. The community is growing fast and libraries are largely compatible. Performance efficiency is high.
- **Windows**: No. Lack of Windows miniforage ARM is sufficiently explained.
- **Linux**: Good for task oriented applications. Certain high performance 3D rendering may be limited. Good power performance for thin client coding.

## Summary
- **Laptops**: Best for portability and moderate analysis tasks, with some ARM options for better energy efficiency.
- **Desktops**: Offer higher performance and memory capacity, suitable for stationary use with high-end GPU options.
- **Workstations**: Provide top-tier performance with advanced GPU and NPU options, ideal for demanding bioimage analysis tasks.
- **Servers**: Unmatched in performance and memory, perfect for large-scale, collaborative, and remote-access analysis tasks, with ARM options for energy-efficient cloud computing.

Choose the appropriate device based on your specific needs, considering the balance between portability, performance, and the nature of your bioimage analysis tasks.
