# Machine learning for image segmentation
In this chapter we will use _classical_ machine learning for pixel classification, object segmentation and for generating probability maps. We will use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for that and [APOC](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc) which is a image-processing specific library which brings GPU-accelerated pixel and object classification.

## Installation of requirements

For execution of the notebooks in this chapter we should install scikit-learn and apoc, e.g. using pip:

```
pip install scikit-learn
pip install apoc
```
