# Tabular data wrangling

Part of a bio-image analyst's work is also to handle tabular data that was extracted from images. In this chapter we will introduce the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library for handling tables and ways for deriving descriptive statistics.

In this chapter, we will work with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) which can be installed using conda:
```
conda install pandas
```
