# Simulating data
For exploring image processing algorithms and in particular for measuring how good they are in solving the tasks they were made for, it makes a lot of sense to simulate datasets. In this chapter, we will simulate images of cells, membranes, and nuclei and give examples of how those can help us better understand what algorithms actually do.
