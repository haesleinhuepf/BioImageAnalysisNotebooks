# Image visualization in 3D

Visualizing three-dimensional image data on a flat computer screen is challenging, especially when working with scripting languages such as Python. In this chapter, we will introduce the concepts of slicing and projecting image data. Furthermore, we will start using the n-dimensional image viewer [napari](https://napari.org).

## Installation of requirements

napari can be installed using conda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge napari
```

or using pip:

```
pip install napari[all]
```

Mac users may have to execute the second command like this:

```
pip install "napari[all]"
```
