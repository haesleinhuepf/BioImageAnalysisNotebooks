# Feature extraction

Feature extraction is a term that refers to retrieving quantitative measurements from image data. This is the step where image data is turned into non-image data. Feature extraction can be applied to images directly, e.g. when measuring the mean average intensity in the image. Technically, counting all nuclei in an image is feature extraction.
It is however more common to apply some form of image segmentation in advance and then extract features of individual objects.
