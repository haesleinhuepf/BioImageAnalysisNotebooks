# # Python code in Jupyter notebooks
# Python code can be written in ".py" files, which can be executed from command line. Furthermore, for academic purposes, [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are often used to document what code does and add additional explanation and link to resources.

# Let's start with some python code, in a Jupyter notebook code cell. You can double click in this cell, change the code and execute it by hitting SHIFT+ENTER:

# In[2]:


print("Hello world")


# * When working with Jupyter notebooks, obviously SHIFT-ENTER is **the** short cut people use all the time. 
# * If you want to "leave" a cell without executing it, you can also hit ESCAPE. 
# * You can add a new cell **a**bove the current cell by hitting A and **b**elow by hitting B. 
# * You can delete cells by hitting D.
# 
# There are more shortcuts. You can see them all in the menu above Help > Keyboard shortcuts or by hitting H.
# 
# Try it out!
